---

## [0:00 - 0:15] Hook

**Visual**: App splash screen → Home dashboard
**Voiceover**:
> "Every group of friends has the same problem: splitting bills is awkward, tracking shared expenses is a mess, and settling up takes forever. Meet Rally — the first app that makes group finance instant, transparent, and actually fun — powered by Solana."

## [0:15 - 0:45] Connect Wallet + Dashboard

**Visual**: Tap "Connect Wallet" → MWA prompt → Approve → Dashboard loads
**Voiceover**:
> "Rally connects to your Solana wallet in one tap using Mobile Wallet Adapter. Immediately you see your balance, your squads, and recent activity. No seed phrases to manage, no complex setup. Just connect and go."

**Show**: Balance display, squad cards, transaction history

## [0:45 - 1:30] Feature 1: Squad Creation + Instant Pay

**Visual**: Create new squad "Weekend Crew" → Add 3 members → Squad created
**Voiceover**:
> "Squads are the heart of Rally. Create one for your roommates, your friend group, your club — anyone you share money with. Each squad gets its own shared wallet on Solana."

**Visual**: Tap Send → Enter 0.5 SOL → Select squad member → Confirm → Transaction confirmed in <2 seconds
**Voiceover**:
> "Sending money is instant. Under a second on Solana, for less than a penny. No waiting, no fees eating into your payment."

## [1:30 - 2:15] Feature 2: Smart Expense Splitting

**Visual**: Tap "Split" → Camera opens → Scan receipt → Items detected → Select members → Auto-split calculated → Send split requests
**Voiceover**:
> "Just got dinner with friends? Point your camera at the receipt. Rally automatically detects the items and splits the bill evenly — or you can customize who pays what. One tap and everyone gets notified. One tap and they settle instantly on Solana."

**Visual**: Show push notification arriving on another device → Tap to settle

## [2:15 - 2:50] Feature 3: Group Pooling + Voting

**Visual**: Navigate to squad → Tap "Pool" → Create "Bali Trip Fund" → Set goal: 10 SOL → Members deposit
**Voiceover**:
> "Planning a trip together? Create a pool. Everyone deposits their share into a shared vault secured by a Solana smart contract. Transparent, trustless, no one person controls the money."

**Visual**: Create proposal "Book the Airbnb - 5 SOL" → Members vote Yes/No → Proposal passes → Funds sent
**Voiceover**:
> "When it's time to spend, anyone can create a proposal. The squad votes. If it passes, the smart contract executes automatically. Democracy in your pocket."

## [2:50 - 3:30] Feature 4: Payment Streaming

**Visual**: Navigate to Streams → Create new stream → Set "Shared Netflix" → 0.001 SOL/day → Recipient → Start stream → Show live counter
**Voiceover**:
> "Why pay for subscriptions monthly when you can stream payments by the second? Rally's streaming engine lets you set up continuous payments — for shared subscriptions, allowances, or anything recurring. Watch the funds flow in real-time. Pause or cancel anytime."

**Visual**: Show the live counter ticking up in real-time

## [3:30 - 3:50] SKR Integration

**Visual**: Show SKR rewards balance, earning animation
**Voiceover**:
> "Rally rewards you for every action — splits, payments, votes — with Seeker tokens. The more you use Rally with your squad, the more SKR you earn. Stake it for reputation, use it for governance, or hold it."

## [3:50 - 4:15] Technical Depth

**Visual**: Quick montage: Anchor program code, transaction on Solana Explorer, MWA connection, push notification
**Voiceover**:
> "Under the hood, Rally runs three custom Solana programs built with Anchor: a shared wallet engine, a payment streaming protocol, and an on-chain voting system. Every transaction is verified on-chain. The app uses Solana Mobile Stack, Mobile Wallet Adapter, and is optimized for Seeker from day one."

## [4:15 - 4:30] Close

**Visual**: Back to home dashboard, squad activity feed, smooth animations
**Voiceover**:
> "Rally makes Solana useful for everyday life. Not for trading — for living. Split the bill. Pool for the trip. Vote on how to spend it. Stream your subscriptions. All instant. All on Solana. All in your pocket."

**Visual**: Rally logo + tagline
> **"Rally — Your Squad's Onchain Wallet."**
